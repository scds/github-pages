# Workshop preparation 

## 1. Create a GitHub account
- Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign up for an account if you don't already have one. 
- After registering, sign in to your account.


## 2. Install GitHub Desktop

{: .warning }
> GitHub does not currently support GitHub Desktop for **Linux** users. You will still be able to learn about Markdown, GitHub, and GitHub Pages without using GitHub Desktop. If you'd like to learn how to use GitHub with local development, [**check out our module on Git**](https://scds.github.io/dash-webinars/vcgit.html).

### Installing GitHub Desktop
- Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
  - Guidance can be found in guides from [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/setting-up-github-desktop).
