# Workshop preparation 

## 1. Create a GitHub account
- Navigate to [**GitHub**](https://github.com) and sign up for an account if you don't already have one. 
- After registering, sign in to your account.


## 2. Install git and GitHub Desktop

{: .warning }
> GitHub doesn't currently support GitHub Desktop for **Linux** users. You will still be able to learn about Markdown, GitHub, and GitHub Pages without using GitHub Desktop. If you'd like to learn how to use GitHub with local development, feel free to attend our other workshop on git [**here**](https://scds.github.io/dash-webinars/vcgit.html).

GitHub Desktop requires git to be installed.
