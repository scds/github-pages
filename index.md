# Getting started with GitHub and GitHub Pages. 

Maybe you've heard of GitHub and would like to learn more about how it works. Maybe you've heard how it's possible to make easy and simple webpages using GitHub and GitHub Pages and want to try. Or maybe, you knew none of this but are intrigued nonetheless. In any of those cases, this tutorial is for you.  

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use a suite of related tools ([Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)) to create and manage repositories of files, and build simple websites with ease! 

## Prerequisites

- A [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) account.
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) installation (This will be covered in the [Preparation](preparation) page)

{: .warning }
> GitHub doesn't currently support GitHub Desktop for **Linux** users. You will still be able to learn about Markdown, GitHub, and GitHub Pages without using GitHub Desktop. If you'd like to learn how to use GitHub with local development, feel free to attend our other workshop on git [**here**](https://scds.github.io/dash-webinars/vcgit.html).

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to: 
- Describe the basics of versioning and versioning software and communicate their value
- Explain the differences between git and GitHub, and describe how they work together
- Use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) to format text in a simple yet effective manner
- Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository
- Create, edit, and manage versions of files in a GitHub repository
- Use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to create simple static web pages using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- Use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to sync files between your desktop/laptop's local repository and the GitHub remote repository
- Identify where you can find more information to experiment and learn on your own

## Duration

This module will take around 1 to 2 hours, however feel free to work at your own pace!
