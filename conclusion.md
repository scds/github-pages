## More about Jekyll
*From [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/):*
> “Jekyll is a static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed on the site, and more.”

GitHub pages uses Jekyll to turn your markdown files (hosted in your GitHub repo) into HTML files and presents them on your desired website. 
- To learn more about Jekyll, visit its [web page](https://jekyllrb.com/) or the [Jekyll project on GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
