## More about Jekyll
*From [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/):*
>“Jekyll is a static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed on the site, and more.”
